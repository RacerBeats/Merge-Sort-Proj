Project Overview: In this two-week project, you will collaborate in groups to design, implement, and analyze the performance of various sorting algorithms covered in Chapter 5. This practical experience will enhance your understanding of sorting algorithm efficiency, implementation techniques, and their real-world applications.

Objectives:

    Design and implement at least three to five sorting algorithms, depending on your learning team members (e.g., Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Shell Sort, Merge Sort, Radix Sort, or Quicksort).

    Analyze and compare the runtime performance and efficiency of each sorting algorithm.

    Apply these algorithms to practical datasets and scenarios.

Week 2 Deliverables (Implementation and Analysis Phase - 50 points):

    Python Implementation (25 points):

        Clear, well-commented Python scripts for each sorting algorithm (15 points).

        Sample input/output demonstrations (10 points).

    Performance Analysis Report (25 points):

        Documented runtime complexities with graphs or tables comparing theoretical vs. practical runtimes (10 points).

        Brief discussion on the efficiency of each algorithm in various real-life scenarios (10 points).

        Reflection on challenges faced and solutions implemented during development (5 points).

Week 2 Rubric:

    Accuracy and functionality of implemented algorithms (15 points)

    Code readability, efficiency, and adherence to Python coding standards (10 points)

    Depth and accuracy of performance analysis and real-life scenario discussions (10 points)

    Quality of reflection on development challenges and solutions (5 points)

Final Presentation (Bonus - 10 points):

    Please deliver a presentation summarizing the outcomes. A YouTube video format would be preferable. The video should be 10-15 minutes, clearly summarizing your findings, implementation details, performance analysis, and real-world applications.
